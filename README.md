This tool will allow you to keep track of the number of attempts and successes against each god when attempting
the Pantheon of Hallownest. Each time you die, select the god who ended your run. The code will update the 
rest of the data.

You can load and save your data as .txt files. They are in a human readable format on purpose, but please do not
edit them. Changing the data may result in problems importing it back into the program.

Made with PySimpleGUI.
