This tool will allow you to keep track of your progress through the various pantheons in Hollow Knight's  
Godmaster DLC. For pantheons, first select the pantheon that you are attempting. Each time you die, select  
the god who ended  your run. The code will update the rest of the data. Clicking on Display Stats will  
show your attempts, successes, and success rate for each boss in the pantheon. 

The program now also supports the Hall of Gods. Clicking on Hall of Gods will open a new window from  
which you can view and update your completion for each boss.  

You can load and save your data as .txt files. They are in a human readable format so you can view them outside  
of running the program, but please do not edit them. Changing the data may result in problems importing it back  
into the program. Upon loading data, you will be asked whether you would like to overwrite or keep the data  
stored in the program. Keeping the data will add your recorded attempts to the data that you're importing  
whereas overwriting the data will toss any data currently stored in the program. Importantly, Hall of Gods does  
not support adding data on top of itself, so choosing to integrate data will simply ignore the Hall of Gods  
data that is stored in the imported text file.

I hope you have fun with Hollow Knight.

Key tools: Visual Studio Code, PySimpleGUI
