# PantheonofHallownestTracker
This tool will allow you to keep track of the number of attempts and successes, as well as your success rate of each god
when attempting the Pantheon of Hallownest.

The program works as follows:
    * Upon startup, you will have the option to load data.
    * Now you have some choices. You may:
        * Enter the full name of the boss to whom you died. This will update the current stats.
        * Enter 'save' to save your data to a file.
        * Enter 'load' to load your data from a file.
        * Enter 'stats' to view your current stats.
        * Enter 'reset' to rest your current stats.
        * Enter 'q' to quit.
    * In order to save or load data, you must provide a file path (i.e. "data.txt", "D:\Hollow Knight\data.txt").
